I am a PhD candidate at the MARCS Institute currently working on a number of research projects in the area of cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics 🎓
I work as a research officer at the Centre for Primary Health Care and Equity, University of NSW 👩‍⚕️
I have recently submitted my Doctoral dissertation investigating bilingual advantages for executive functions in young adults 🧠
My dissertation is entitled: The impurity problem in bilingual advantage for executive functions: Shining a light on the "elephant in the room" 🐘 
I am particularly interested in second language learning and its influence on the brain and cognition. 🗣️
I also have an interest in the measurement of complex psychological phenomena, neuropsychological conditions resulting in executive dysfunction including their prevention and progression across the lifespan, health care accessibility, and the social determinants of health and wellbeing ❤️‍🩹
I worked in sexual and reproductive health research for six years and remain passionate about gender-related issues in health care across both physical and mental health 🚺🚹
