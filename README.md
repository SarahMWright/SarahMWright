I recently completed my PhD at the MARCS Institute for Brain, Behaviour and Development, Western Sydney University 🎓 
My Doctoral dissertation investigated bilingual advantages for executive functions in young adults 🧠
My dissertation was entitled: The impurity problem in bilingual advantage for executive functions: Shining a light on the "elephant in the room" 🐘 
I continue to work on a number of research projects in the area of cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics 
I also work as a senior project officer at the International Centre for Future Health Systems, University of New South Wales 👩‍⚕️
I am particularly interested in second language learning and its influence on the brain and cognition. 🗣️
I also have an interest in the measurement of complex psychological phenomena, neuropsychological conditions resulting in executive dysfunction including their prevention and progression across the lifespan, health care accessibility, and the social determinants of health and wellbeing ❤️‍🩹
I worked in sexual and reproductive health research for six years and remain passionate about gender-related issues in health care across both physical and mental health 🚺🚹
